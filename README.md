# Pima-Indians-Diabetes-Prediction
Using HyperParameter Tuning

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook analyzing the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, a dataset that helps predict diabetes based on medical attributes.

💂 Project Overview

The Pima Indians Diabetes Database contains diagnostic measurements to determine if a patient is likely to develop diabetes. This project demonstrates:

Data Preprocessing (handling missing values, standardization)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature Engineering

Machine Learning Models (Decision Trees)

Hyperparameter Tuning (GridSearchCV)

📊 Dataset Information

Dataset: Pima Indians Diabetes Database (from Kaggle)

Features:
